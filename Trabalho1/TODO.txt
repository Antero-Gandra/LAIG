TODO/Bugs

- Component children need to apply their transformations first (back court rotation is weird)
(also noticeable in back of back boards, they rotate in Z too for some reason probably related)(?)
- Texture scaling not done yet
- Interface choose view
- Interface light names
- Update yas format to new class ortho(some values aren't given, use 0 or 1)
