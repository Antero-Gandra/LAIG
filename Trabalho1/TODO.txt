TODO/Bugs

- Component children need to apply their transformations first (back court rotation is weird)
(also noticeable in back of back boards, they rotate in Z too for some reason probably related)(?)
- Don't generate a root component, root most be defined in xml, (allows unused components to be defined) (teacher verified)
(we can still print in )
- Texture scaling not done yet
- Use materials list
- Interface choose view
- Interface light names
- Update yas format to new class ortho(some values aren't given, use 0 or 1)
